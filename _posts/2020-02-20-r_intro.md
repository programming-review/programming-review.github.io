To start with R programming language I created a small overview of what are the most important things to learn first.

## How to start R on Google Colab?

It is possible to run R directly on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#create=true&language=r){: rel="nofollow"}. This means you don't need to set the environment on your end, just to start and experiment with R.

## How to get R version?

There are several ways to get the R version.
All these works:
```r
R.Version()
R.version
R.version.string
version
```
, but my favorite is just `version`.

## How to get built-in objects?

There is a simple `builtins()` command helping to _return the names of all R built-in objects. These objects are fetched directly from the symbol table of the R interpreter._

![builtins](/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/r1.jpg)

I saw inside the `builtins()` the `print` function for example. This is the great intro for the next section.

## How to get info about any function in R?

The key is to use the `?` operator. `?print` returned the description:


_**print** prints its argument and returns it invisibly (via **invisible(x)**). It is a generic function which means that new printing methods can be easily added for new classes._

>You can also use `help(print)` to get the same results.

[Online](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.5.0/topics/print){:rel="nofollow"} information about `print` is also helpful.

For me the crucial thing was to use to the idea that every function in R has a package it belongs to. In case of `print` it is the _**base**_ package.

## How to show all R options?

To show all R options you simple type:

```r
print(options())
```

`options()` allow the user to set and examine a variety of global _options_ which affect the way in which R computes and displays its results.


## Print and alter the particular option in R
To print a single option you may use `getOption`:

_Example:_
```r
op='width'
getOption(op, default = NULL)
# same as options(op)
```
_Output:_
```
80
```

Here is how the `width` 80 looks:

![width 80 in R](/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/r3.jpg)

And if we alter the width option to 30 the output is different:

![width 80 in R](/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/r4.jpg)



## How to plot a simple function graph in R?

For the most basic example you will need to have a `seq` sequence from

## How to get help on help in R?

It may be interesting but `help(help)` is also useful.

This will show the full list of `help` argument options:
```r
help(topic, package=NULL, lib.loc=NULL, verbose=getOption("verbose"), try.all.packages=getOption("help.try.all.packages"), help_type=getOption("help_type"))
```

Also `help` is interesting because you can `help.search()` on any term which is the same as `??`.

_Example:_
```r
help.search('abs')
# or simple
??abs
```

## How to get list of R available packages?

`library()` will list all R available packages, `search()` will list all loaded packages.

You can load (attach) a package with:
`library("dplyr')`. Inside a function check if a package has been loaded with `require("dplyr")` that returns either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

## How to list available datasets in R?

`data()` will list all available datasets.

Also `data` loads specified datasets.

## How to get help on any package?

Crutial in R is to get the list of all members from the package. For that case you use again the `help` method but you need to set the package:

_Example:_
```r
help(package='base')
```
_Output:_
![R base package methods](/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/r7.jpg)
![R base package methods](/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/r8.jpg)
The output is huge and shows all R methods from the `base` package.

## How to get the list of all R operators?

_Example:_
```r
?Syntax
```
This is very easy with the `Syntax` command from the `base` package. `Syntax` outlines R syntax and gives the precedence of operators.

```
The following unary and binary operators are defined.  They are
     listed in precedence groups, from highest to lowest.

       ':: :::'           access variables in a namespace              
       '$ @'              component / slot extraction                  
       '[ [['             indexing                                     
       '^'                exponentiation (right to left)               
       '- +'              unary minus and plus                         
       ':'                sequence operator                            
       '%any%'            special operators (including '%%' and '%/%') 
       '* /'              multiply, divide                             
       '+ -'              (binary) add, subtract                       
       '< > <= >= == !='  ordering and comparison                      
       '!'                negation                                     
       '&  &&'            and                                          
       '| ||'             or                                           
       '~'                as in formulae                               
       '-> ->>'           rightwards assignment                        
       '<- <<-'           assignment (right to left)                   
       '='                assignment (right to left)                   
       '?'                help (unary and binary)  

```
