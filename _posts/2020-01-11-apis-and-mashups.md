John Musser did it again. A great web site http://www.programmableweb.com/ with all the API and Mashups tracking.



ProgrammableWeb is where you can keep-up with what's new and interesting with mashups, Web 2.0 APIs, and the new Web as Platform.



The core of the site is the news blog and the 4 dashboards: Home, Mashups, APIs, and Members. New updates every day, 365 days a year.



Get the answer what is new to mashups or APIs? 

Also use the Mashup Listings for ideas. Check the API Listings to see what APIs are available and contribute via the Share page to add a mashup.



See the API Dashboard or see the Popular New Mashups to find which have succeeded.



Great contributors also http://www.programmableweb.com/about/contributors
