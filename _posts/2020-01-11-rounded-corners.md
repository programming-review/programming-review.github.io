You need to have the CSS for rounders corners for every HTML element that support border radius.

Here is the code. Eventually this will not work for IE8- browsers.



<pre>.rounded-corners {

    -moz-border-radius: 20px;

    -webkit-border-radius: 20px;

    -khtml-border-radius: 20px;
Thanks
    border-radius: 20px;

}

</pre>
