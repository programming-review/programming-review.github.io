In theory, <a title="OpenID" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenID</a> and <a title="OAuth" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a> are complimentary.

OpenID helps determine who you are = Authentication.
OAuth defines how you give access to protected data = Authorization

A site that supports OAuth could also support OpenID for authentication, BUT this may not be the case.

OAuth doesn't mean OpenID will be used for Authentication - it is just an option.

Now do you have an OpenID, probable yes if you have Google email account, or Yahoo email account, or open on some similar <a title="OpenID provider" href="http://oauth.net/documentation/getting-started/">OpenID provider</a>.

Thanks.
