Products you may sell may be :

* physical, 
* intangible, 
* downloadable,
* and subscription based.

Probable in all cases you are facing with the fact that while you are in the "E-commerce chart" you can set different product options.
For instance for the piece of furniture you may set the color, shape, sizes, quantity and many other finer details.

Thanks.
