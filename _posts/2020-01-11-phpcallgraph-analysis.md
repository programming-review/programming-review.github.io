Available <a href="http://phpcallgraph.sourceforge.net/">here</a> phpCallGraph is a tool to detect static function calls in PHP source code. 

Later we may use some graph visualization programs to present function calls.
 
The core of the call graph generator forms an object-oriented PHP5 library, which may also be integrated in other projects. 

Thanks
