<pre><code>long-running-command &amp;</code></pre>
The ampersand in the end of this command tells this command will be executed in the background. After starting a command, you can press <kbd>Ctrl+</kbd><kbd>Z</kbd> to suspend it, and then <code>bg</code> to put it in the background if you want.

This way still command output and command errors willÂ show up in the terminal. But you can try this:
<pre><code>long-running-command &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</code></pre>
<code></code>With the last line you will not get the standard output (/dev/null ) and the errors will be redirected also to the standard output meaning will not show.
