Provided the list of WordPress filters in <a href="https://programming-review.com/wordpress-filters-list/">here</a>, created some time ago. In fact the list is not grouped. How would you group all WordPress filters?



In fact on the following pageÂ <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference%20">http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference </a>I found the answer:


* 1 Post, Page, and Attachment (Upload) Filters
* 2 Comment, Trackback, and Ping Filters
* 3 Category and Term Filters
* 4 Link Filters
* 5 Date and Time Filters
* 6 Author and User Filters
* 7 Blogroll Filters
* 8 Blog Information and Option Filters
* 9 General Text Filters
* 10 Administrative Filters
* 11 Rich Text Editor Filters
* 12 Template Filters
* 13 Registration & Login Filters
* 14 Redirect/Rewrite Filters
* 15 WP_Query Filters
* 16 Media Filters
* 17 Advanced WordPress Filters
* 18 Widgets
* 19 Admin Bar



Not all filters are covered but the grouping is awe.
