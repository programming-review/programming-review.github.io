Well, after 12 years, it was about the time.

<blockquote>Better performance, versatility, and faster booting. Using identical hardware, KVM Linodes are much faster compared to Xen.



For example, in our UnixBench testing a KVM Linode scored 3x better than a Xen Linode. During a kernel compile, a KVM Linode completed 28% faster compared to a Xen Linode.



KVM has much less overhead than Xen, so now you will get the most out of our investment in high-end processors.KVM Linodes are, by default, paravirtualized, supporting the Virtio disk and network drivers. However, we also now support fully virtualized guests – which means you can run alternative operating systems like FreeBSD, BSD, Plan 9, or even Windows – using emulated hardware (PIIX IDE and e1000).



We’re also working on a graphical console (GISH?) which should be out in the next few weeks.</blockquote>
