<p dir="ltr"><strong>Intro</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Every shopping card solution must have one payment system. Most popular payment systems are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>PayPal</li>
	<li>Authorize.Net</li>
	<li>PayPal Pro</li>
	<li>Google Checkout</li>
	<li>2Checkout</li>
</ul>
Some of these are:
<ul>
	<li>payment gateways only,</li>
	<li>payment gateway + merchant accounts = PG+MA
(PayPal  and Google Checkout for example).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">For PG+MA user doesn't leave your site. A payment system is used to take the electronic payment from an online transaction. This is also known as Electronic Data Interchange or EDI.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Payment Systems:</p>
&nbsp;
<h4>PayPal standard payment system</h4>
More popular than PayPal Pro. It is recommended for shops starting out. You don't need SSL s certificate for your web site. The customers pays off site, and they will be sent to the PayPal. They have two options to set the payment. They can choose to pay with the credit card or login with their own PayPal account.
<p dir="ltr">Notice: You don't need to have PayPal account when paying via PayPal. You can pay just via Credit card. PayPal standard is easily integrated with all eCommerce, it is recommended for new sits, because there is no monthly fee. This may change, but the current fee you pay is per transaction only (2.9% + $0.3 per each transaction).</p>
&nbsp;
<h4 dir="ltr">Authorize.net payment system</h4>
<p dir="ltr">You would like to have your own web site to process the payment. It can integrate with all popular shopping carts solution. The user never leave your site. You need SSL certificate = HTTPS.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is a gateway only not the payment processor. If you sign out for Authorize.Net you only have the gateway, and you need to find the payment processor on your own. This is where the idea of using some Authorize.Net reseller is great. Because Authorize.Net reseller provides the gateway and the payment processor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you would do w/o the reseller you need to pay $99 Authorize.Net setup fee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The treat thing about Authorize.Net—it has a physical terminal so you can work with physical credit cards on your web site. The payments will be sent to your bank account.</p>
The current fee : $20/mos + $0.10 per trans action (this may change). Pricing depends if you go via reseller.

&nbsp;
<h4 dir="ltr">Google Checkout payment system</h4>
<p dir="ltr">You don't need the SSL certificate. Customer pays out of the web site. It is fast because so many people have Google account. In fact, customers don't even have to have the Google account.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is integrated in many platforms and free of monthly fees. The fee is per transaction = 2.9% + $0.3</p>
&nbsp;
<h4 dir="ltr">Paypal Payments Pro payment system</h4>
<p dir="ltr">On web site payment solution starting from $30 per month. It supports recurrent payments, but you need SSL. You can manage PPP via Standard Paypal account.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Customer doesn't need to have PP account, just the credit card. It has the virtual terminal to accept the credit cards.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>

&nbsp;
<h4 dir="ltr">2Checkout payment system</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Payments is done off site. It integrates well with PP. Customer doesn't know you pay via 2Checkou. You don't needed SSL certificate - in most cases. Customers can pay via PP or via credit card. You have the $10.95 monthly fee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You also have the 2.9% + $0.45 transaction fee.</p>
