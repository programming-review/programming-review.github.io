## WPF or WinForms

Starting with 2006 WPF was released and it seams that today it is a clear winner if you plan to create applications for windows.

### WPF

WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) is based on DirectX with **XAML** support and uses markup language for designing UI allowing the design of complex user interfaces with easy UI customization and style override.

It even renders faster compared to WinForms.
Can handle large datasets thanks to [UI virtualization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/advanced/optimizing-performance-controls?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8#displaying-large-data-sets){:rel="nofollow"}.

It takes up more RAM than WinForms.

It offers effective and fully supported data binding as compared to WinForms.

It is good choice when creating non standard UI.



## ListBox WPF

```c#
if (listbox1.SelectedIndex != -1)  listbox1.Items.Remove(listbox1.Items[listbox1.SelectedIndex]);
```
Adding new item to the listbox
```c#
listbox1.Items.Add(textbox1.Text);
```

## Image

```c#
image1.Source = new BitmapImage(new Uri("hero-2-7.jpg", UriKind.Relative));
```

## Datatable

Example of 2x2 datatable.
```c#
var dt = new DataTable();
dt.Columns.Add( "Key");
dt.Columns.Add( "Value");

dt.Rows.Add( new object[] { "Key1", "Value1"});
dt.Rows.Add( new object[] { "Key2", "Value2"});
```
To create the `DataTable` we can also use:

```c#
DataTable dt = new DataTable();
```

**Tip:** To view the content of `dt` object while debugging you can hover on it and click view in MVS.

We can use:

```c#
List<Person> ps = Person.LoadAll();
dataGridView1.DataSource = ps;

// Person is a class
```

### WinForms

WinForms are using windows common controls and event-driven design approach. With WinForms you cannot design web apps.

In comparison to WPF it is a bit harder to implement MVC (Model View Controller) model.

It is good to develop default Windows style applications.
