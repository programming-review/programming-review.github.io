A Perl function (subroutine) is a group of statements. In Perl you can use the terms: subroutine, method and function as you wish.

## Define and Call a Subroutine

Perl defines a subroutine like this:
```perl
sub perl_subroutine_name{
   body of ...
}
```

The typical way of calling that Perl subroutine is as follows ?
```perl
perl_subroutine_name( list of arguments );
```

Before Perl 5.0, the syntax for calling subroutines was different:
```
&subroutine_name( list of arguments );
```

The old style will work in the newest versions of Perl, but it is not recommended.


_Example function definition:_
```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
sub perl_hello{
   print "Hello, World!\n";
}
```
_Example function call:_
```perl
perl_hello();
```

_Output:_
```
Hello, World!
```
