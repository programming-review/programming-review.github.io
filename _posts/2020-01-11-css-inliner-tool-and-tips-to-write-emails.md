You need to create emails.
Here are some tips:

* Use <a rel="nofollow" href="http://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/">in-line CSS tool</a> since styles aren't always supported.
* Don't use button element: use anchors instead.
* Use table layouts: best supported.
* Don't use rowspan: spacing issues.
* Don't use background images: Limited support.
* Style image tags with "display:block": fixes weird spacing issues with hotmail.
* If using multiple tables nest them in one parent table: stops spacing issues.
* Don't use Javascript: not well supported.
* Make sure email looks good even with no images: may not load.
