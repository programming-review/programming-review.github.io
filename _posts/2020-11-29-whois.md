A whois record contains all the contact information associated with the person, company, or other entity that registered the domain name.


Some registrations contain more information than others, and some registries return differing amounts of information.

A typical whois record will contain the following information:

    The name and contact information of the registrant: The owner of the domain.
    The name and contact information of the registrar: The organization that registered the domain name.
    The registration date.
    When the information was last updated.
    The expiration date.


## Whois on domain 

```
whois cnn.com
```


whois cnn.com in a terminal window

The response from the whois registry starts with a summary, and then repeats itself with extra information included. We’ve included an example below with trademark statements and terms of use removed:


The second section contains the address and name of the registrant, Amazon.com, Inc. The web address in the “Ref:” field contains this information in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

The other sections contain contact information that allows you to report issues regarding abuse, network operation, traffic routing, and so on.
Using whois in a Script

To use whois in a script, let’s assume we have a set of domains for which we need to check the expiration dates. We can accomplish this with a small shell script.

Type this into an editor, and save it as “get-expiry.sh”:

#!/bin/bash

DOMAIN_LIST="howtogeek.com reviewgeek.com lifesavvy.com cloudsavvyit.com"

echo "Expiration dates:"

for domain in $DOMAIN_LIST
do
  echo -n "$domain :: "
  whois $domain | grep 'Expiration' | awk '{print $5}'
done

Set the script to have executable permissions by using the chmod command, as shown below:

chmod +x get-expiry.sh

chmod +x get-expiry.sh in a terminal window.

Run the script by calling it by name:

./get-expiry.sh

./get-expiry.sh in a terminal window.

The expiration date for each domain is extracted from the response from whois by using grep to find lines that contain the string “Expiration,” and using awk to print the fifth item from that line.

Convenience and Automation

Yes, you can also perform whois lookups online. However, having the whois command available in the terminal window and scripts offers convenience, flexibility, and gives you the option to automate some of your workload.

## Find server 
curl ipinfo.io/8.8.8.8
```
{
  "ip": "8.8.8.8",
  "hostname": "dns.google",
  "city": "Mountain View",
  "region": "California",
