Is your web browser (on your device) really good? How can you test that? Is the security the only thing you should consider? What about HTML5 and CSS3?



These and similar questions I asked myself and I started a journey where I tried to examine that. Basically the only thing I should use as "known" is that later releases of some popular browsers are better then the older versions. Or---this is just almost, because in some cases some this may not be true. Internet Explorer 4 to Internet Explorer 5 switch :)



However, I found that noways browsers should be at least HTML5 and CSS3 friendly.



There are two web sites that utilize tests Web Browser tests for HTML5 (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://html5test.com/">http://html5test.com/</a>) and CSS3 (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://css3test.com/">http://css3test.com/</a>)



For instance the maximum number of points for HTML5 test is 555, and my Chromium browser took excellent 483 points.

For the CSS3 test I took only 658 of 1341 points = 57 percents.

From the security perspective the things are complicated. Nearly never the systems are built perfect, and some security problems may be understood over the time.



Since browsers can be customized--- it is up on you to do the customization to improve the security. For instance here is the good reference point: http://its.ucsc.edu/software/release/browser-secure.html



But even if you apply all the rules for improving the security of your web site you don't know if you are secure? And this is the problem.



There should be a web site that can provide at least some answers about your browser: https://browsercheck.qualys.com/
