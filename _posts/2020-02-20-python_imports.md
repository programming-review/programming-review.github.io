To master Python `imports` like a pro you need to experiment with these three imports:

* Import a Python **standard library**
* Import Python **third party package**
* Import from **local** packages

 Youâ€™ve learned the best practices for writing import statements, and you know the difference between absolute and relative imports.

You will also need to understand that most frequent imports are:
*  **package** import 
*  **subpackage** import 
*  **module** import 
*  **class** and
*  **function** import

, but you can also import a **constant**.

Finally you need to make practice in both **relative** and **absolute** import style.

## What is Python imports?
