In the very last article of this <a href="https://programming-review.com/cssdivs/">tutorial</a> I will give you the minimal 2 column website layout achieved via CSS.

<a href="https://programming-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2columnlayout.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-188" title="2columnlayout" src="https://programming-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2columnlayout.png" alt="" width="909" height="465" /></a>


Here div <strong>C </strong>represents the container. Divs <strong>H </strong>represents the header, div <strong>A</strong> represents the main content area, div <strong>B</strong> is the sidebar div, and the div <strong>F</strong> is the footer.

We used all the tips from the <a href="https://programming-review.com/cssdivs/">tutorial</a> here.



First we used <strong>overflow: auto; </strong> in the container div C. This will center the container div as we explained in the first article of this tutorial <a href="https://programming-review.com/automargin/">How to set the div in the center of a web browser using margins</a>.



Then, you noticed that all the divs inside the container div C are non overlapping â€” as explained in the <a href="https://programming-review.com/child-divs/">Adding child divs to a parent div</a> article.



We used floating divs to construct the layout and we used <strong> clear: both</strong> clearing as explained in <a href="https://programming-review.com/floating-divs/">Floating divs</a> article.



&nbsp;



We also used an image in the container div for better visual experience.

<pre>#C {

 background: url(background.png);

}</pre>

You may download the background image from <a href="https://programming-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/background.png">here</a>.

Hope you have enjoyed the tutorial and good luck with your website design.

Thanks.
