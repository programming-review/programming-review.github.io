CentOS Firefox plugins are stored to this location <code>/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins</code>.

These are files with .so extension. 

The process of adding a Flash Plugin is simple downloading a tarball for Flash from this address http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/.

The tarball has tar.gz format. In the tarball you will find the <code>libflashplayer.so</code>.

Thanksall the Flash player you need to: 

1. Copy <code>libflashplayer.so</code> file to the plugins foder <code>/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins</code>

2. Restart the Firefox.



Thanks.
