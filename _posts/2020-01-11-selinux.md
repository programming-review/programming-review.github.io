SELinux stands for (S)ecurity (E)nhanced Linux.

From Wikipedia 
<blockquote>It is a Linux feature that provides the mechanism for supporting access control security policies, including United States Department of Defense-style mandatory access controls, through the use of Linux Security Modules (LSM) in the Linux kernel. It is not a Linux distribution, but rather a set of Kernel modifications and user-space tools that can be added to various Linux distributions. Its architecture strives to separate enforcement of security decisions from the security policy itself and streamlines the volume of software charged with security policy enforcement. The key concepts underlying SELinux can be traced to several earlier projects by the United States National Security Agency.

Practically SELinux has a command line and GUI tools for managing security features.
I will dig into the command line some other time, and for now type this: <code>system-config-selinux</code>
to start the SELinux GUI interface.

It will look something like this
