Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud uses Amazon Simple Storage Service to store and access your images. Your Amazon EC2 subscription will also enable your account to use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud and Amazon Simple Notification Service. You will not be charged for these services unless you decide to use them. After completing the sign-up process, you will have signed up to use Amazon SNS, S3, and VPC. 

<h2>First step â€” sign up to EC2</h2>

<h3>Sign up surprise! AWS is free for the new AWS customers</h3>

<pre>Free tier for new AWS customers* 
New AWS customers will receive the following EC2 services each month for one year. Usage is calculated each month across all regions and automatically applied to your bill - unused monthly usage will not roll over. Restrictions apply; see offer terms for more details. 
750 hours of Amazon EC2 running Linux/Unix Micro Instance usage (613 MB of memory and 32-bit and 64-bit platform support) - enough hours to run steady state each month
750 hours of Elastic Load Balancing plus 15 GB data processing
10 GB of Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) plus 1 million IOs, 1 GB snapshot storage, 10,000 snapshot Get Requests and 1,000 snapshot Put Requests
15 GB of bandwidth in and 15 GB of bandwidth out aggregated across all AWS services</pre>

<h3>Sign up surprise! AWS price differs region from region</h3>

I don't know the Amozon policy but, from some reasons the price for their services is not the same comparing to different regions. 
For instance: US-East (Northern Virginia) Region 
<code>Amazon EC2 running Linux/UNIX = $0.085 per Small Instance (m1.small) instance-hour (or partial hour)</code>

US-West (Northern California) Region 
<code>Amazon EC2 running Linux/UNIX = $0.095 per Small Instance (m1.small) instance-hour (or partial hour)</code>

EU (Ireland) Region 
<code>Amazon EC2 running Linux/UNIX = $0.095 per Small Instance (m1.small) instance-hour (or partial hour)</code>

Asia Pacific (Singapore) Region 
<code>Amazon EC2 running Linux/UNIX = $0.095 per Small Instance (m1.small) instance-hour (or partial hour)</code>

Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region 
<code>Amazon EC2 running Linux/UNIX = $0.10 per Small Instance (m1.small) instance-hour (or partial hour)</code>

First you may note that "Amazon EC2 running SUSE Linux" is different from "Amazon EC2 running Linux/UNIX" because SUSE is not for free.
Windows is also the option, but it is in general more expensive than the previous 2 solutions. Windows with SQL Server even more.
Next, there are so called "Amazon Dedicated" machines like "Amazon Dedicated EC2 running Linux/UNIX". Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 Instances that run on hardware dedicated to a single customer for additional isolation. This was the particular request from some of the major customers and Amazon delivered.


<h3>Service surprise! The AWS Free Usage Tier</h3>
* The AWS Free Usage Tier is available for all new AWS customers and expires one year from your AWS sign up date. 

<h3>Service surprise! for Data Transfer</h3>
<code>Across Data Transfer** $0.000 per GB - first 15 GB of data transferred in per month*</code>
This means you don't pay anything for the first 15GB of data transfer across Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon SimpleDB, Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS and Amazon VPC.

When your free usage expires or if your application runs over the free usage tiers, you simply pay standard, pay-as-you-go service rates. 
Your usage is calculated each month across all regions and automatically applied to your bill - unused monthly usage will not roll over. 

<h3>Service surprise! No charges</h3>
- There is no Data Transfer charge for data transferred between Amazon EC2 and other AWS services within a single region, excluding RDS.
- There is no Data Transfer charge for data transferred within an Amazon S3 Region via a COPY request. Data transferred via a COPY request between Regions is charged at regular rates.
- There is no Data Transfer charge for data transferred between the Amazon EC2 US-East (Northern Virginia) Region and the Amazon S3 US Standard Region.
- There is no Data Transfer charge for data transferred between Amazon EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone using private IP addresses (i.e., $0.00 per GB)

<h3>Charges</h3>
- Data transfer "in" and "out" refers to transfer into and out of an AWS Region.
- Data transferred between AWS services in different regions will be charged as Internet Data Transfer on both sides of the transfer (i.e. between the Amazon EC2 Northern California and Amazon S3 US Standard Regions).
- Data transfer between two Amazon EC2 instances in the same Region (or between Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon RDS DB Instances in the same Region) is charged as Regional Data Transfer on both sides of the transfer.
Usage for other Amazon Web Services is billed separately from Amazon EC2.
- Amazon CloudWatch
- Elastic IP Addresses
- Amazon Elastic Block Store

<h3>Terminology</h3>
<h4>Elastic IP Addresses</h4> Elastic IP addresses are static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account not a particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however, Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or Availability Zone failures by programmatically remapping your public IP addresses to any instance in your account. Rather than waiting on a data technician to reconfigure or replace your host, or waiting for DNS to propagate to all of your customers, Amazon EC2 enables you to engineer around problems with your instance or software by quickly remapping your Elastic IP address to a replacement instance. In addition, you can optionally configure the reverse DNS record of any of your Elastic IP addresses by filling out a form.

<h4>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</h4> Amazon VPC is a secure and seamless bridge between a companyâ€™s existing IT infrastructure and the AWS cloud. Amazon VPC enables enterprises to connect their existing infrastructure to a set of isolated AWS compute resources via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection, and to extend their existing management capabilities such as security services, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems to include their AWS resources.

<h4>Elastic Load Balancing</h4> Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. It enables you to achieve even greater fault tolerance in your applications, seamlessly providing the amount of load balancing capacity needed in response to incoming application traffic. Elastic Load Balancing detects unhealthy instances within a pool and automatically reroutes traffic to healthy instances until the unhealthy instances have been restored. You can enable Elastic Load Balancing within a single Availability Zone or across multiple zones for even more consistent application performance. Amazon CloudWatch can be used to capture a specific Elastic Load Balancerâ€™s operational metrics, such as request count and request latency, at no additional cost beyond Elastic Load Balancing fees. 

<h4>Amazon Elastic Block Store</h4> (EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EBS volumes are off-instance storage that persists independently from the life of an instance. Amazon Elastic Block Store provides highly available, highly reliable storage volumes that can be attached to a running Amazon EC2 instance and exposed as a device within the instance. Amazon EBS is particularly suited for applications that require a database, file system, or access to raw block level storage.
