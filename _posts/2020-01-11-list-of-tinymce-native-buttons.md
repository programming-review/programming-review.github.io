With the latest release of TinyMCE 4.x there are some default buttons included: 
Here is the list: 

<code>bold
italic
underline
strikethrough
justifyleft
justifycenter
justifyright
justifyfull
bullist
numlist
outdent
indent
cut
copy
paste
undo
redo
link
unlink
image
cleanup
help
code
hr
removeformat
formatselect
fontselect
fontsizeselect
styleselect
sub
sup
forecolor
backcolor
forecolorpicker
backcolorpicker
charmap
visualaid
anchor
newdocument
blockquote
separator ( | is possible as separator, too)</code>

However, the list can be further improved by adding the TinyMCE plugins:
<code>advhr
emotions
fullpage
fullscreen
iespell
media
nonbreaking
pagebreak
preview
print
spellchecker
visualchars</code>

You can write new TinyMCE plugins to provide more TinyMCE buttons. TinyMCE plugins are JavaScript based.
You can write TinyMCE pugins to override existing buttons functions.

Many software developers relay on TinyMCE features, such as right click context menus, secure file upload, etc...
