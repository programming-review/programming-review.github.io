Most of the programmers I know can be divided into two major groups: 
* those who are comfortable doing what they know, and 
* those who always keep learning and studying new techniques. 
 
For the first ones, "it works" can define them; for the second group, we can use "it can work better" to describe how they constantly think. 

As languages, frameworks, and OSs keep changing, if you are part of the first group, you are in trouble. I must confess that, when we are talking about Swift, in the same way that a lot of developers (1) have work to do, (2) have their own projects and (3) have families, (4) get frustrated by the compiler crashing (SourceKit service crashed ðŸ˜©), and (5) <a href="https://github.com/researchkit/researchkit">even Apple still uses Objetive-C for new frameworks</a>, my knowledge in Swift is not exactly <a href="http://nshipster.com">where I desired it would be.</a></p>
<p>But it's never too late - and I wanted to share some cool methods of the Swift Array class, related to sorting objects, that I learned recently. Enough with Philosophy, let's take a look in those methods than can save you time, lines, and most important, can be efficient. I will go over 6 instance methods - the ones who differ most from the range of methods provided NSArray  - and compare how I would do them in Objective-C, to show how powerful is Swift. If you come from a Ruby, Groovy, or any scripting language background, they may look more familiar.</p>
<p>Besides the gists provided here as examples, I'm providing also a playground file so you can download and play with it.</p>
<h2>Reverse</h2>
<p>Let's start with the easiest one: reversing objects in an array. Imagine you have a list of messages or posts that you fetch from your database, from the most recent to the oldest. After displaying the data, imagine you want to go over</p>
<h2>Sort</h2>
