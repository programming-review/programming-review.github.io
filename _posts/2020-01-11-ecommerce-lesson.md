	<li>Services... (web design, landscaping, hosting, ... ).</li>

</ol>

	<li>Online auctions such as on Ebay.com, uBid.com, govsales.com. It is the online experience of the physical auction.</li>

	<li>Internet banking. Extremely convenient to transfer money like bankofamerica.com - also the anonymous Internet banking such as the Bitcon.com</li>

<p dir="ltr">Strange enough, behind these 4 eCommerce acronyms all eCommerce can be classified:</p>

	<li>B2C = these are the businesses like Amazon, and other selling to consumers, this is the most most popular class also...</li>

	<li>C2C = certain web sites allow just that. A common example is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_auction">online auction</a>.</li>

</ol>

<h4>Who should use eCommerce?</h4>

Anyone in the right way. If you have small little shop that builds souvenirs you can expose your products to millions of people.

<p dir="ltr">What is the coolest eCommerce branch at the moment?</p>

<p dir="ltr">Probable the M-commerce, or Mobile commerce. This is a new term when people are shopping via Phone while sitting in a waiting room. mCommerce will be very popular in the future.</p>
