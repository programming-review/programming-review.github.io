Occasionally I need to get the phpinfo() for the web servers I work on. Phpinfo-print WordPress provides just that in the simple and traditional style.

Now, there are some other plugins, for the same thing, but these do not look exactly like the output of phpinfo() function.

Here are the screenshots:
