Stated simple : Truly open platform for all kinds of mobile devices = Android.

Leading in this development are Google Inc, HTC, T-Mobile, Intel, and few others.



The Android platform represents:

* an operating system,
* middleware,
* a user-friendly interface and
* powerful applications

This fully integrated bundle of software will significantly lower the current costs of developing mobile devices and services.



The Android platform is licensed under one of the most progressive open-source licenses available giving operators and manufacturers unprecedented freedom to design, build and distribute their own products.
