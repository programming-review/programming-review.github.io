The very first program I wrote in Swift was this:
```swift
var üëç = "ok"
print(üëç)
```
Swift supports emo

var fColumnEqual : Float =  1+2
print(fColumnEqual)

_Example Optional type:_
```swift
var num: Int? = nil
print(num)
print(type(of: num))
```
_Output:_
```
nil
Optional<Int>
```

Optional type is the special type that can hold a value but also a `nil` value (non-value).

Optionals types are written by appending a ? to a  type. For instance `Int?`.
