You work with underscores (underscores.me) and you create your first WordPress theme. Now you need to create a screenshot image for your theme.

WordPress themes should have a default image called screenshot.png. This image should be in indexed color modes, to save space. To create one you would simple create a screenshot from your theme and save that screenshot to a file screenshot.png that is predefined in the underscores theme.

This file uses indexed color mode, so you need first to update that mode to RGB for instance, then paste your screenshot and then back to indexed mode.
