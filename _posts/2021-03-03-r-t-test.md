If we have a population (random variable $X$) and two samples from that population, **t-test** allows us to compare the average values of the two datasets and to determine if samples came from the same population $X$.

Usually the check is based on 5% level of significance which is the same check as if the true mean is inside 95 percent confidence interval.


**Example:** t-test 


## Calculating t-Tests

To run a **t-test** we need:

* difference between the mean values from each data set (called the mean difference)
* the standard deviation of each group
* and the number of data values $N_i$

At the end we will get **t-value**.
