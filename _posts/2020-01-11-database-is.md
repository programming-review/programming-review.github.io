Database is used to store information like your customer’s information – <em>first name, last names, email address, address, and etc</em>… Database is very useful on a dynamic website (<em>type of website that needs frequent change of content like news, e-commerce, blog, and etc…</em>), because you can easily retrieve, save, update, and delete data.

<em>Database</em> is composed of tables. A <em>Table</em> is composed of rows of data just like what you see in your excel file. (See Image below)

The text in blue at the top of each column is called “<em>field name</em>“, in excel it is called column title. Field names are very important because these serves as the labels of your data, you cannot either create a table without “<em>field names</em>“.

Suppose, we will store basic information of our client:
<ul>
	<li>First Name</li>
	<li>Last Name</li>
	<li>Middle Name</li>
	<li>Email Address</li>
</ul>
The first thing that we need to do is to create a database name “<strong>user</strong>” and a table name “<strong>user</strong>” having a field names of<em>first_name, middle_name, last_name, and email</em>. Our database structure would be the same as the image below.

As you can see on the image above, our <em>database</em> consist of <em>1 table</em> that has <em>field names and data in it</em>.

I’ll teach you on how to create a database and table, on my next topic.
