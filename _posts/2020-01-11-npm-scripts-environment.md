Gulp, Grunt, Brokoli, Brunch, Bower maybe you can forget.

You can use directly npm command line scripts to get the same. These are the favorites scripts:

```
autoprefixer, browser-sync, clean, 
eslint, imagemin-cli, node-sass, 
onchange, npm-run-all, postcss-cli,
svgo, svg-sprite-generator, uglify-js
```
