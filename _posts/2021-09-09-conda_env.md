A virtual environment creates a container with _Python runtime_ (Python interpreter and Python libraries). 

Virtual environments are isolated from default and other Python virtual environments.


## How to achieve project isolation

Pip is Python package manager and allows specific Python package installation, update, removal or other details.

Virtualenv -- virtual environment allows you to work in an isolated version of Python.

Each virtual environment has its own version of Python.

Python virtual environments are configured through a configuration file called the site-packages folder. 

Conda is similar to virtualenv and it is not limited to Python only. 

Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing that uses conda.

Jupyter Notebook (acronym of three languages â€” Julia, Python and R) is an interactive web application from which you can run commands. The main achievement here would be to select a specific conda environment from where you will run Jupyter Notebook.

Although the task looks small it is very important from the Project isolation perspective.


## Package Management in Pip

Use pip to install a package by name. pip looks for the package in PyPI to calculate dependencies, and installs them. 

It is always a good idea to upgrade pip to the latest version.

```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

or even better

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Check the version of the pip:

```
pip -V
```

Don't run `python pip` directly. This will not work. pip is not a command line argument python understands.

pip works from python as a main module so use the `-m` switch. This would work:

```
python pip -m install numpy
```
instead of 

```
python pip install numpy
```
but even better and more simpler would be:

```
pip install numpy
```
which assumes a `-m` switch.

## Pip vs. Conda

The important difference between these two:

pip installs Python only packages while conda installs packages written in any language.

Another thing, conda can create isolated environments.

You should call:

```
conda info
```
to get the feedback on the conda environment that is running.

To list all the environments:
```
conda info --envs
```

Python environment is a directory that contains a copy of everything Python needs to run including:

* a copy of the python binary
* a copy of Python standard library
* a copy of the pip installer
* a copy of Python packages


## Creating a New Environment in Conda

Let's create a new Python environment "opencv" and let's add the opencv-python package inside.

First if you open the anaconda command prompt you may find something like this:

```
(base) C:\Users\dj>
```

In here the "(base)" corresponds to the base environment which is by default. The "C:\Users\dj" is the current user folder.

Let's create a new environment named opencv.

```
conda create --name opencv
```

This will output:

```
## Package Plan ##

  environment location: C:\Users\dj\anaconda3\envs\opencv

#
# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate opencv
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate
```

From there you can just activate the environment with: 

```
conda activate opencv
```

![activate opencv](/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opencv2.png)


This will lead to the new prompt:

```
(opencv) C:\Users\dj>
```

To return to base: 

```
conda deactivate
```


## Conda Change the Python Version

It is possible to set Python version when creating the conda environment:

```
conda create --name opencv python=3.7
```

Once you create conda environment you can alter the version of Python:

```
conda install python=3.6
```

This will remove the old and set the new Python 3.6 version inside the environment.

## Use Conda Environment from Jupyter

Let's also make this Python environment visible from the Jupyter notebook so we can use it anytime.


There are a couple of steps to add a new Conda environment to your Jupyter notebook.

**Step 1: Activate the Environment**

First you activate opencv

```
(base) C:\Users\dj>activate opencv

(opencv) C:\Users\dj>
```

**Step 2: Install ipkernel** 

For the environment to become a kernel install ipkernel:

```
(opencv) C:\Users\dj>conda install ipykernel
```

  
**Step 3: Connect with Jupyter** 

Register the kernel spec with Jupyter:

```
(opencv) C:\Users\dj>ipython kernel install --user --name=opencv
Installed kernelspec opencv in C:\Users\dj\AppData\Roaming\jupyter\kernels\opencv
```

**Step 4: Test**
