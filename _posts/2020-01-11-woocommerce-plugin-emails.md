WooCommerce is a free eCommerce plugin for WordPress that allows you to sell anything.

Probable the best way to start working with WooCommece is to start thinking what you can offer? 



Your offer can be:

* a digital good, 
* WordPress plugin or theme
* some program, 
* a service 
* a material item. 

You can pick on any of these.


The second thing is how you can interact on your web site with your clients both before the sell and after the sell. 

After you create a sell, you also created a commitment of some kind, because you will need to send the emails to the client. Yet, you can relax because WooCommerce will do the emailing for you. 



In the very essence the WooCommerce has all kind of the emails you need. These are called email templates.

Types of the emails you can get out of the box from WooCommerce:



* New order
* Cancelled order
* Failed order
* Processing order
* Completed order
* Refunded order
* Customer invoice
* Customer note
* Reset password
* New account



New order emails are sent to chosen recipient(s) when a new order is received.



Canceled order emails are sent to chosen recipient(s) when orders have been marked canceled (if they were previously processing or on-hold)



Failed order emails are sent to chosen recipient(s) when orders have been marked failed (if they were previously processing or on-hold).



Processing order, is an order notification sent to customers containing their order details after payment. You will certainly have lot of these.



Order complete emails are sent to customers when their orders are marked completed and usually indicate that their orders have been shipped.



Order refunded emails are sent to customers when their orders are marked refunded.



Customer invoice emails can be sent to customers containing their order information and payment links.



Customer note emails are sent when you add a note to an order, and you can specify these custom messages in the product details section of the product.



Customer "reset password" emails are sent when customers reset their password



Customer "new account" emails are sent to the customer when a customer signs up via checked our account pages 



Email templates are customizable so there is an option for you to create your very own templates.

The procedure is somehow similar to overriding the child theme templates.



To override and edit new order email template copy woocommerce/templates/emails/admin-new-order.php to your theme folder: your-theme-folder/woocommerce/emails/admin-new-order.php.
